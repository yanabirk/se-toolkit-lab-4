Create a git commit following Conventional Commits.

## Format

```
type(scope): subject

Optional body — use when additional context helps reviewers understand
why the change was made. Write in imperative mood. Use a bullet list
when describing multiple changes. Wrap at 72 characters.

Co-Authored-By: <your current model name> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Rules

- **type**: `feat` (new content/feature), `fix` (correction/improvement), `docs` (documentation-only), `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- **scope**: area of change, e.g. `docs`, `lab`, `config`
- **subject**: lowercase, present tense, imperative mood, no period at the end
- Keep the subject line concise (under 72 characters)
- Add a body when the subject alone doesn't fully explain the change — e.g. non-obvious decisions, side effects, or grouped changes. Separate from the subject with a blank line. Write in imperative mood; use a bullet list when the body covers multiple points
- Always include the `Co-Authored-By` trailer with your current model name (e.g. `Claude Opus 4.6`, `Claude Sonnet 4.6`)
- If the user specifies files via $ARGUMENTS, stage only those files. If `$ARGUMENTS` is literally `staged`, skip staging and commit whatever is already in the index
- If a file lives inside a **git submodule**, `cd` into that submodule's directory before running `git add` / `git commit`. Detect by running `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from the file's directory — if it differs from the parent repo root, the file is in a submodule
- If changes are unrelated, make **separate commits** — one per logical group. Never bundle unrelated changes into a single commit
